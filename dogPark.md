> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

## Post-MVP

-_User Stats_

- 	_Based on table of correct questions and numbers of existing questions._


-_Instructor Managment of cohorts, categories, and questions._

_Cohorts_

- _Cohorts should be in flatlist. Swiping on cohort yields options to edit or delete._
 - _Circle with Plus icon on bottom right to add a cohort._
 - _The user should be prompted to enter their password if they chose the delete option._
 - _The user should be able to view a sub-flatlist with the members listed._

_Categories and Questions_

- _Categories And Questions managment should be in a flatlist as well._
 - _Categories would be similar to implementation of Cohorts._
 - _Tapping the add icon the user would see preconstructed choices as well as the option for custom entry._
   -_Clicking on a category would lead to a nested sub-flatlist showing the Categories' Questions._

-_VS game mode for users to play with other users._

- _Create a game mode selection screen_
